# Express.js Route Handler Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: lack of error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

The bug occurs when the route attempts to parse a non-numeric user ID as an integer.  Without proper error handling, this can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes.  The solution adds input validation and comprehensive error handling to prevent this issue.
